	<h1 align="center">SEON: The Software Engineering Ontology Network</h1>

	<p>SEON provides a well-grounded network of SE reference
		ontologies, and mechanisms for deriving and incorporating new
		integrated domain ontologies into the network.</p>
	<p>SEON results from various efforts on building ontologies for the
		Software Engineering (SE) field. Although SEON itself is a new
		proposal, the studies and ontologies developed along the years are
		important contributions for defining this network. Hence, SEON rises
		with three main premises:
	<ol type="i">
		<li>being based on a well-founded grounding for ontology development;</li>
		<li>offering mechanisms to support building and integrating new SE
			domain ontologies to the network; and</li>
		<li>promoting integration by keeping a consistent semantics for
			concepts and relations along the whole network.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>Currently, the SEON Network is composed of the networked
		ontologies shown in Figure 1.</p>

	<h2>SEON's Architecture</h2>
	<p>SEON architecture is organized considering three ontology
		generality levels as Figure 2 shows.</p>

	<h3>Foundational layer</h3>
	<p>
		At the bottom of SEON, there is the Unified Foundational Ontology
		(UFO), which is developed based on a number of theories from Formal
		Ontology, Philosophical Logics, Philosophy of Language, Linguistics
		and Cognitive Psychology. UFO [<a
			href="http://doc.utwente.nl/50826/1/thesis_Guizzardi.pdf"
			target="_blank">1</a>] is divided in three parts: an ontology of
		endurants (objects), an ontology of perdurants (events), and an
		ontology of social entities. UFO's ontological distinctions are used
		for classifying SEON concepts, e.g., as <i>objects</i>, <i>actions</i>,
		<i>commitments</i>, <i>agents</i>, <i>roles</i>, <i>goals</i> and so on.
		UFO provides the necessary grounding for the concepts and relations of
		all networked ontologies.
	</p>

	<h3>Core layer</h3>
	<p>In the center of SEON, providing the SE core knowledge for the network,
		there is the Software Process Ontology (SPO). SPO is a core ontology
		grounded in UFO, aiming at establishing a common conceptualization on
		software processes. SPO scope embraces the following aspects of the
		software process domain: standard, project and performed processes and
		their activities, artifacts handled, resources used and procedures adopted,
		and stakeholders participation. SPO reuses some concepts from the Enterprise
		Ontology (EO), a core ontology on enterprises (external to SEON), for dealing
		with aspects related to organizations, such as team membership. Another
		external ontology related to this layer is the Core Ontology on Measurements (COM)
	</p>

	<h3>Domain-specific layer</h3>
	<p>Over the foundational and core layers, domain ontologies appear.
		Each domain networked ontology is grounded in core ontologies and in UFO,
		and encompasses a SE subdomain (e.g., software requirements, design,
		configuration management, and measurement). Although not explicit in Figure 2,
		more specific domain ontologies can be developed based on other more general
		domain ontologies. For instance, ontologies addressing runtime requirements (RRO),
		goal-oriented requirements (GORO) and the requirements development process (RDPO)
		were developed based on the Reference Software Requirements Ontology (RSRO).
		For matter of organization, domain networked ontologies can be grouped in subnetworks,
		as the Requirements engineering Ontology subNetwork (ReqON).

	<p>In a nutshell, the foundational ontology offers the ontological
		distinctions for the core and domain layers, while the core layer
		offers the SE core knowledge for building the domain networked
		ontologies. This way of grounding the ontologies in the network is
		helpful for engineering the networked ontologies, since it provides
		ontological consistency and makes a number of modeling decisions
		easier.</p>

	<h2>SEON's Search Mechanism</h2>
	<p>As SEON grows, the number of network ontologies and their
		concepts increases. In order to facilitate exploring the network and
		identifying the concepts for integration or reusing, the SEON
		Specification provides a simple search mechanism. This feature is able
		to locate the desired concepts by maching the search string with the
		concepts' names and definitions.</p>
