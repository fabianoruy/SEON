<p align="justify">In GORE, the domain characterization (and further identification of requirements and so on) is obtained initially by modeling the agents' goals. Agents bear intentional properties such as Beliefs and Intentions. These intentional properties are called Mental Moments. A Goal is a propositional content of an Intention. An Intention represents not only a will but also an internal commitment of the Agent to act towards the Goal, implying in a Plan to accomplish it. In that way, a Goal as an Intention should be associated with a Plan. Thus, Goals with associated Plans to accomplish them (Tasks) are propositional contents of Intentions.<br/><br/>In a Software Engineering process, a requirement does not refer necessarily to software. Hence, a Requirement is a Goal, in the scope of a specific problem, that describes environmental conditions to be achieved through a desired solution resulting in satisfaction of the underlying strategic goals.<br/><br/>Hardgoals are defined as propositions that are objectively satisfied by a given set of situations. In constrast, Softgoals refer to a vague quality region whose exact boundaries are unknown. <br/></p>
