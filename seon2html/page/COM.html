<b>COM::Ordinal Scale</b><br/>
Specializes COM::Scale, UFO::Ordinal MeaRefDimension<br/><br/>
Scale whose Scale Values can be mapped to a certain order or ranking.<br/>
Ex.:<i> the measure client satisfaction degree, which can be mapped to the values “high”, “medium” or “low”, has an Ordinal Scale.</i><br/>

</table><br/>
<b>COM::Rational Scale</b><br/>
Specializes COM::Scale, UFO::Rational MeaRefDimension<br/><br/>
Scale in which it is possible to quantify the distance between its Scale Values, there is a value to represent nonentity (absolute zero) and it is possible to establish relations between Scale Values.<br/>
Ex.:<i> the measure distance in kilometers has a rational scale, since 0km means the absence of distance, it is possible to quantify the distance between scale values (e.g., there are 10km between the distances 20km and 30km) as well as establish other relations between them (e.g., we can say that 100km is twice longer than 50km).</i><br/>

<b>COM::Scale</b><br/>
Specializes UFO::Measurement Reference Structure<br/><br/>
Delimitates the space of values possible to be associated by a Measure to a Measurable Element.<br/>
Ex.:<i> the scale of the measure height in meters is a liner structure isomorphic to the positive half-line of the real numbers.</i><br/>
<br/>
Relations:<br/>
<code>Scale (1..1) <>-- (2..*) Scale Value<br/>
Scale (1..*) partitioned according to (0..1) Measure Unit<br/>
Measure (1..1) has (1..1) Scale<br/>
</code><br/>
<br/><br/>

<b>COM::Scale Value</b><br/>
Specializes UFO::Measurement Reference Region<br/><br/>
Value that compose a Scale.<br/>
Ex.:<i> 0.5, 1, 1.8 are examples of values that compose the scale of the measure height in meters.</i><br/>
<br/>
Relations:<br/>
<code>Scale (1..1) <>-- (2..*) Scale Value<br/>
</code><br/>

</table><br/>
<b>COM::Simple Goal</b><br/>
Specializes UFO::Goal<br/><br/>
Goal that is not composed by others.<br/>
Ex.:<i>  Monitor the patient’s blood pressure.</i><br/>
