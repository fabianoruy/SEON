<p align="justify">A Program is defined as a Software Item, a piece of software, produced during the software process, not considered a complete Software Product, but which aims at producing a certain result through execution on a computer, in a particular way, given by the Program Specification. In other<br/>words, a Program intends to implement a Program Specification, that intends to satisfy a set of Requirement<br/>Artifacts. Thus, we can say that there is a relation between Program and Requirement Artifact that is derived from the existing relation between Program Specification and Requirement Artifact.<br/><br/>A Loaded Program Copy is the materialization of a Program, inhering in a Machine. The Loaded Program Copy is a complex Disposition that is constituted by one or more Software<br/>Functions, which are, in turn, instances of Software Function Universals. When the software development process is accomplished correctly, the Software Functions that constitute the (loaded) program copy are instances of the exact Software Function Universals described by the Program Specification and successfully implemented by the Program.<br/><br/>Program Copy Execution is an Event representing the execution of the Loaded Program Copy running in a Machine, i.e., the Program Copy Execution is the event of the physical manifestation of the dispositions, represented as the complex disposition Loaded Program Copy, that inhere in the Machine. In this context, the Machine participates in the Program Copy Execution playing the role of Controller.<br/><br/>A Program Copy Execution, as an event, brings about a particular situation, said an Observable State. An Observable State is a situation resulting from the execution of a program copy.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></p>

<p align="center"><b>Figure 2. RRO - RTR conceptual model.</b></p>
<p align="justify">The first important distinction in the Runtime Requirements sub-ontology is between Runtime Requirement Artifacts, those that can be used by Program Copy Executions at runtime, from their non-runtime counterparts, named Design Time Requirement Artifacts.<br/><br/>Runtime Requirement Artifact is further specialized into two specific subtypes: Monitoring Runtime Requirement Artifact defines the criteria for verifying if a requirement is being satisfied or not at runtime; on the other hand, Change Runtime Requirement Artifact specifies changes on the system’s behavior, in order for the software system to keep fulfilling the goals it has been designed for. <br/><br/>An RRT Program is a Program that is built intending to satisfy at least one Runtime Requirement Artifact. The aforementioned distinction between runtime requirement artifacts also reflects in RRT Programs (and in the corresponding Loaded Program Copies that materialize them and in the Program Copy Executions that are executions of the latter). Thus, RRT Program is specialized in Compliance<br/>Program, representing those RRT Programs that intend to satisfy at least one Monitoring Runtime Requirement<br/>Artifact, and Adaptation Program, representing those RRT Programs that intend to satisfy at least one Change Runtime Requirement Artifact. The generalization set of RRT Program is not disjoint, since the same program can intend to satisfy, at the same time, both a Monitoring Runtime Requirement Artifact and a Change Runtime Requirement Artifact. Finally, some RRT Programs are built to act over (monitor/change) specific programs. When a Program is the target of an RRT Program, we say that it plays the role of a Target Program.<br/>A Loaded RRT Program Copy is the materialization of an RRT Program, while an RRT Program Copy Execution is the execution of a Loaded RRT Program Copy. An RRT Program Copy Execution uses Runtime Requirement Artifacts as resources. A Compliance Program Copy Execution<br/>uses Monitoring Runtime Requirement Artifacts, and monitors Observable States produced by another Program Copy Execution, said Target Program Copy Execution. While using requirements at runtime, we are not interested in situations arising from the execution of any program, but only in those<br/>arising from the Target Program Copy Executions. For this reason, a Compliance Program Copy Execution monitors  Target Execution States, i.e, the situations arising from the Target Program Copy Execution. The Compliance Program Copy Execution monitors the Target Execution States to verify<br/>if the runtime requirements comply with the criteria specified in the Monitoring Runtime Requirement Artifacts. If one or more requirements are not being fulfilled accordingly, an Adaptation Program Copy Execution can trigger changes in the the Loaded Program Copy being monitored, which is said<br/>a Loaded Target Program Copy, by using Change Runtime Requirement Artifacts. Like the RRT Program generalization set, the generalization set of RRT Program Copy Execution<br/>(and also of Loaded RRT Program Copy) is not disjoint, since the same RRT Program Copy Execution can use, at the same time, both a Monitoring Runtime Requirement Artifact and a Change Runtime Requirement Artifact. </p>
